### Unicode locale ID for Spanish, Somali, Hmong

Unicode locale identifiers (also known as IETF language tags) follow the pattern of `languagecode-countrycode`. For the languages you mentioned, here are the Unicode locale identifiers:

1. **Spanish**: The identifier varies depending on the specific country. Here are a few examples:

   - Spain: `es-ES`
   - Mexico: `es-MX`
   - United States: `es-US`

2. **Somali**: The identifier is:

   - `so-SO`

3. **Hmong**: The identifier varies slightly based on region, but generally:
   - `hmn` (generic, without a specific region)
   - `hmn-CN` (Hmong in China)
   - `hmn-US` (Hmong in the United States)
